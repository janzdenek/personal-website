abstract: "The increasing interest in scene text reading in multilingual environments raises the need to recognize and distinguish between different writing systems. In this paper, we propose a novel method for script identification in scene text using triplets of local convolutional features in combination with the traditional bag-of-visual-words model. Feature triplets are created by making combinations of descriptors extracted from local patches of the input images using a convolutional neural network. This approach allows us to generate a more descriptive codeword dictionary for the bag-of-visual-words model, as the low discriminative power of weak descriptors is enhanced by other descriptors in a triplet. The proposed method is evaluated on two public benchmark datasets for scene text script identification and a public dataset for script identification in video captions. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline and yields competitive results on all three datasets."
